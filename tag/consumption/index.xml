      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the path of economic inequality in Japan spanning four decades (1981-2021) using the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Over this period, inequality in earnings, disposable income, and consumption has widened. Earnings inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, exhibited a non-linear in- crease from 0.24 to 0.29, with a significant rise in the 1980s and early 2000s. Conversely, disposable income showed a modest downward trend since the mid- 2010s. Despite this, consumption inequality continued to rise moderately, indicat- ing a divergence in the dynamics of disposable income and consumption inequality. Analysis from a life cycle perspective confirms the different shapes of age profiles for income and consumption inequality. Our findings also highlight substantial variations in age-specific inequality across different consumption items.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Effects of Monetary Policy Shocks on Inequality in Japan</title>
      <link>https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/project/inui_sudo_yamada/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The impacts of monetary easing on inequality have been attracting increasing attention recently. In this paper, we use the micro-level data on Japanese households to study the distributional effects of monetary policy. We construct quarterly series of income and consumption inequality measures from 1981 to 2008, and estimate their response to a monetary policy shock. We find that monetary policy shocks do not have a statistically significant impact on inequality across Japanese households in a stable manner. When considering inequality across households whose head is employed, we find evidence that, before the 2000s, an expansionary monetary policy shock increased income inequality through a rise in earnings inequality. Such procyclical responses are, however, scarcely observed when the current data are included in the sample period, or when earnings inequality across all households is considered. We also find that transmission of income inequality to consumption inequality is minor, including during the period when procyclicality of income inequality was pronounced. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with attached labor inputs, we show that labor market flexibility is central to the dynamics of income inequality after monetary policy shocks. We also use the micro-level data on households&amp;rsquo; balance sheets and show that distributions of households&amp;rsquo; financial assets and liabilities do not play a significant role in the distributional effects of monetary policy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Note on Risk Sharing against Idiosyncratic Shocks and Geographic Mobility in Japan</title>
      <link>https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/project/yamada_2014/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this study, using Japanese household panel data, we analyze how well idiosyncratic income risks are shared by regions. We find that geographic mobility influences individual consumption growth rates, suggesting that complete asset markets fail to exist. We reject the full insurance hypothesis for both urban and rural areas and find that the extent of risk sharing differs significantly by region.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-sectional Facts in Japan using Keio Household Panel Survey</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate economic inequalities of Japanese economy from 2004 to 2012 us- ing the Keio household panel survey. We present cross-sectional dispersion earnings, consumption expenditure, and wealth inequalities from time-series and life cycle dimensions. Wage and hours inequalities, which are calculated from the earnings of male and female, full-time and part-time workers and correlations are provided. We also show that the residual inequalities, which are usually interpreted as idiosyncratic income risks that households face, rise over the life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inequalities in Japanese Economy during the Lost Decades</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the development of inequalities in income, consumption, and wealth among Japanese households from the 1980s to the 2000s, a period that spans the bursting of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bubble economy (1991Q1) and the banking crisis (1997Q4). We find that inequality of income and consumption widened during those three decades, and inequality of wealth increased, except for during the period after the bubble burst. Income inequality grew noticeably during the bubble era and periods after the banking crisis and the growth rate was particularly high during the former period. The two crises affected income inequality differently. The bubble burst led to a slow income growth for all households without greatly affecting the distribution of income, whereas the banking crisis dampened income growth exclusively among lowquantile households, exacerbating income inequality. Although the distributional effect of government policy was important, the general pattern of income inequality carried over into inequality in consumption. The dimensions of that carryover, however, diminished after the bubble burst, suggesting compositional changes in income shocks. The inequalities over life cycle are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Consumption, Working Hours, and Wealth Determination in Life Cycle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an empirical analysis of a life cycle model. We incorporate labor supply and family structure into the standard precautionary savings model and estimate structural parameters based on the moment conditions for the life cycle profiles of consumption, working hours, and wealth accumulation. Our empirical analyses with Japanese household data reveal that consideration of both family structure and idiosyncratic shocks are crucial in modeling consumption and working hours profiles simultaneously under plausible parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;
