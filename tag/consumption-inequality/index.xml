      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the path of economic inequality in Japan spanning four decades (1981-2021) using the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Over this period, inequality in earnings, disposable income, and consumption has widened. Earnings inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, exhibited a non-linear in- crease from 0.24 to 0.29, with a significant rise in the 1980s and early 2000s. Conversely, disposable income showed a modest downward trend since the mid- 2010s. Despite this, consumption inequality continued to rise moderately, indicat- ing a divergence in the dynamics of disposable income and consumption inequality. Analysis from a life cycle perspective confirms the different shapes of age profiles for income and consumption inequality. Our findings also highlight substantial variations in age-specific inequality across different consumption items.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Time Trend and Life-cycle Profiles of Consumption</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper analyzes the time trend of household consumption in Japan between 1981 and 2020, using microdata from the Family Income and Expenditure Survey (FIES). We examine how the trends in the levels, shares, and growth of consumption vary across categories of consumption, items and age groups, and assess changes in consumption inequality over time. Our analysis shows that consumption inequality mildly increased, driven primarily by the trend of service consumption. Additionally, we estimate the life-cycle profiles of consumption and find that the age component of total consumption follows a standard hump-shaped pattern, but varies significantly across goods and service categories and item groups. Finally, using the estimated age profiles of different consumption items, we project how aggregate consumption and its composition may evolve as Japan’s population ages in the coming decades.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Dimensions of Inequality in Japan: Distributions of Earnings, Income and Wealth between 1984 and 2014</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Inequality has become a central policy issue around the world. We study trends of inequality in earnings, income and wealth across households in Japan, using the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE) from 1984 to 2014. We focus on the transition of inequality unconditionally and conditionally across various dimensions of household heterogeneity such as age, cohort, employment and marital status of household heads, sources of income, family size, etc. Inequality in earnings, income and wealth all increased during the last three decades. Changes in earnings and income inequality were mostly driven by demographic shift in the population towards the elderly, who tend to have higher inequality. Wealth inequality rose not only in the aggregate but also among the young, and this is due to a major increase in the fraction of households who own zero or very low wealth across all age groups. Critical factors in understanding inequality trends in Japan that we identified are aging demographics, changes in typical household structure, and macroeconomic trends of the past decades including the financial bubble period and a decades-long slow-down thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cross-sectional Facts in Japan using Keio Household Panel Survey</title>
      <link>https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/project/yamada_2013/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We investigate economic inequalities of Japanese economy from 2004 to 2012 us- ing the Keio household panel survey. We present cross-sectional dispersion earnings, consumption expenditure, and wealth inequalities from time-series and life cycle dimensions. Wage and hours inequalities, which are calculated from the earnings of male and female, full-time and part-time workers and correlations are provided. We also show that the residual inequalities, which are usually interpreted as idiosyncratic income risks that households face, rise over the life cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inequalities in Japanese Economy during the Lost Decades</title>
      <link>https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/project/sudo_suzuki_yamada_2012/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the development of inequalities in income, consumption, and wealth among Japanese households from the 1980s to the 2000s, a period that spans the bursting of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bubble economy (1991Q1) and the banking crisis (1997Q4). We find that inequality of income and consumption widened during those three decades, and inequality of wealth increased, except for during the period after the bubble burst. Income inequality grew noticeably during the bubble era and periods after the banking crisis and the growth rate was particularly high during the former period. The two crises affected income inequality differently. The bubble burst led to a slow income growth for all households without greatly affecting the distribution of income, whereas the banking crisis dampened income growth exclusively among lowquantile households, exacerbating income inequality. Although the distributional effect of government policy was important, the general pattern of income inequality carried over into inequality in consumption. The dimensions of that carryover, however, diminished after the bubble burst, suggesting compositional changes in income shocks. The inequalities over life cycle are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;
