      <title>Inequality Dynamics in Japan, 1981-2021</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper examines the path of economic inequality in Japan spanning four decades (1981-2021) using the Family Income and Expenditure Survey. Over this period, inequality in earnings, disposable income, and consumption has widened. Earnings inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, exhibited a non-linear in- crease from 0.24 to 0.29, with a significant rise in the 1980s and early 2000s. Conversely, disposable income showed a modest downward trend since the mid- 2010s. Despite this, consumption inequality continued to rise moderately, indicat- ing a divergence in the dynamics of disposable income and consumption inequality. Analysis from a life cycle perspective confirms the different shapes of age profiles for income and consumption inequality. Our findings also highlight substantial variations in age-specific inequality across different consumption items.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Inequalities in Japanese Economy during the Lost Decades</title>
      <link>https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/project/sudo_suzuki_yamada_2012/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the development of inequalities in income, consumption, and wealth among Japanese households from the 1980s to the 2000s, a period that spans the bursting of Japan&amp;rsquo;s bubble economy (1991Q1) and the banking crisis (1997Q4). We find that inequality of income and consumption widened during those three decades, and inequality of wealth increased, except for during the period after the bubble burst. Income inequality grew noticeably during the bubble era and periods after the banking crisis and the growth rate was particularly high during the former period. The two crises affected income inequality differently. The bubble burst led to a slow income growth for all households without greatly affecting the distribution of income, whereas the banking crisis dampened income growth exclusively among lowquantile households, exacerbating income inequality. Although the distributional effect of government policy was important, the general pattern of income inequality carried over into inequality in consumption. The dimensions of that carryover, however, diminished after the bubble burst, suggesting compositional changes in income shocks. The inequalities over life cycle are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Consumption, Working Hours, and Wealth Determination in Life Cycle</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents an empirical analysis of a life cycle model. We incorporate labor supply and family structure into the standard precautionary savings model and estimate structural parameters based on the moment conditions for the life cycle profiles of consumption, working hours, and wealth accumulation. Our empirical analyses with Japanese household data reveal that consideration of both family structure and idiosyncratic shocks are crucial in modeling consumption and working hours profiles simultaneously under plausible parameter values.&lt;/p&gt;
