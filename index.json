We also evaluate effects of foreign workers on skill-specific wages in Japan and welfare consequences across heterogeneous individuals. A rapid rise in the relative size of high-skilled labor force in Japan will give strong downward pressure on skill premium and an arrival of foreign workers is shown to have large differential effects on skill prices and the trend of wage inequality, depending on their size and skill composition.","tags":["Population Aging","Fiscal Sustainability","Foreign Worker","Skill Premium","OLG Model"],"title":"Foreign Workers, Skill Premium and Fiscal Sustainability in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagiri Kitao","Takeki Sunakawa","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"チュートリアルセッションで使用したスライドはGitHubからダウンロードできます。 すべてのコードはJuliaで書かれています。 簡易的なJuliaインストールマニュアル（Install_Julia.pdf）も含まれているので参考にしてください。\n北尾さんのスライド 砂川さんのスライド\u0026amp;コード CodeボタンがGitHubリポジトリへのリンクです。 ","date":1621036800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621036800,"objectID":"930b1c6aa20163379890e00227418589","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/computation/jea2021/","publishdate":"2021-05-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/computation/jea2021/","section":"computation","summary":"2021年度日本経済学会 春季大会のチュートリアルセッションで使用したマテリアル一式。","tags":null,"title":"チュートリアルセッション@日本経済学会 2021年度春季大会","type":"computation"},{"authors":["Sagiri Kitao","Takeki Sunakawa","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"『経済セミナー』で2018年12月・2019年1月号から2020年2・3月号まで合計8回にわたって、「定量的マクロ経済学と数値計算」という連載講義を行いました（北尾早霧氏・砂川武貴氏と共著）。 連載で使用したすべてのコードはGitHubからダウンロードすることができます。 主にMatlabで書かれていますが、一部、PythonやJuliaも使用しています。\nCodeボタンがGitHubリポジトリへのリンクです。 ","date":1580083200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1580083200,"objectID":"7e1121dde8e1aba06efb49a7b4e7820d","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/computation/keizai_seminar/","publishdate":"2020-01-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/computation/keizai_seminar/","section":"computation","summary":"『経済セミナー』で2018年12月・2019年1月号から2020年2・3月号まで合計8回にわたって、「定量的マクロ経済学と数値計算」という連載講義を行いました(北尾早霧氏・砂川武貴氏と共著)。","tags":null,"title":"定量的マクロ経済学と数値計算@経済セミナー","type":"computation"},{"authors":["Selahattin Imrohoroglu","Sagiri Kitao","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1566777600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1566777600,"objectID":"81fb690d6047853385aad81478a17bd7","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/publication/imrohoroglu_kitao_yamada_joea_2019/","publishdate":"2019-08-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/imrohoroglu_kitao_yamada_joea_2019/","section":"publication","summary":"Japan leads all advanced economies in terms of aging and has the highest debt to GDP ratio. The public pension, medical and long-term care (LTC) expenditures are projected to far outpace revenues and create significant fiscal burdens. In this paper, we develop a detailed overlapping generations model that incorporates the social insurance programs in detail, use most recent estimates from Japanese micro data and government demographic projections to discipline the earnings and labor supply profiles of heterogeneous agents and their cohort shares, and simulate future paths of fiscal and macroeconomic indicators. Our numerical results suggest that absent any change in current policies, Japan will continue to run large pension, public health, LTC, and basic deficits and the debt to GDP ratio will continue to reach unprecedented highs, with interest payments on the debt becoming larger and larger. Although no single policy tool can address fiscal consolidation, a combination of policies is found to achieve sustainability: raise the retirement age to 67, cut pensions by 10%; raise copays of health and LTC insurances to 20%, and find policies to propel female employment and earnings to the levels of their male counterparts, and increase consumption tax rate to 15%. Under these changes, the debt to output ratio in 2050 would be lower than that in 2020.","tags":["Population Aging","Fiscal Sustainability","Social Security System","Health Insurance","Female Labor","OLG Model"],"title":"Fiscal Sustainability in Japan: What to Tackle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sagiri Kitao","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"Inequality has become a central policy issue around the world.

Wealth inequality rose not only in the aggregate but also among the young, and this is due to a major increase in the fraction of households who own zero or very low wealth across all age groups.

In this paper, we use the micro-level data on Japanese households to study the distributional effects of monetary policy. We construct quarterly series of income and consumption inequality measures from 1981 to 2008, and estimate their response to a monetary policy shock. We find that monetary policy shocks do not have a statistically significant impact on inequality across Japanese households in a stable manner. When considering inequality across households whose head is employed, we find evidence that, before the 2000s, an expansionary monetary policy shock increased income inequality through a rise in earnings inequality. Such procyclical responses are, however, scarcely observed when the current data are included in the sample period, or when earnings inequality across all households is considered. We also find that transmission of income inequality to consumption inequality is minor, including during the period when procyclicality of income inequality was pronounced. Using a two-sector dynamic general equilibrium model with attached labor inputs, we show that labor market flexibility is central to the dynamics of income inequality after monetary policy shocks. We also use the micro-level data on households’ balance sheets and show that distributions of households’ financial assets and liabilities do not play a significant role in the distributional effects of monetary policy.\nBIS Working Papers, No. 642, 2017.

We present an empirical analysis of inequality that specifically considers the path from individual wages and earnings, to household earnings, after-tax income, and finally consumption. We find that household earnings inequality rose substantially over this period. This rise is made up of two distinct episodes: from 1981 to 1996 all incomes rose, but they rose faster at higher percentiles; from 1996 to 2008 incomes above the 50th percentile remained flat but they fell at and below the 50th percentile. Inequality in disposable income and in consumption also rose over this period but to a lesser extent, suggesting taxes and transfers as well as insurance channels available to households helped to insulate household consumption from shocks to wages. We find the same pattern in inequality trends when we look over the life cycle of households as we do over time in the economy. Additionally we find that there are notable differences in the inequality trends for wages and hours between men and women over this period.","tags":["Income Inequality","Consumption Inequality","Wealth Inequality","FIES","NSFIE"],"title":"Wage, Income and Consumption Inequality in Japan, 1981-2008: from Boom to Lost Decades","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nao Sudo","Michio Suzuki","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" Presented at the 5th Annual CIGS Conference on Macroeconomic Theory and Policy 2014.

We find that inequality of income and consumption widened during those three decades, and inequality of wealth increased, except for during the period after the bubble burst. Income inequality grew noticeably during the bubble era and periods after the banking crisis and the growth rate was particularly high during the former period. The two crises affected income inequality differently. The bubble burst led to a slow income growth for all households without greatly affecting the distribution of income, whereas the banking crisis dampened income growth exclusively among lowquantile households, exacerbating income inequality. Although the distributional effect of government policy was important, the general pattern of income inequality carried over into inequality in consumption.

We find that inequality of income and consumption widened during those three decades, and inequality of wealth increased, except for during the period after the bubble burst. Income inequality grew noticeably during the bubble era and periods after the banking crisis and the growth rate was particularly high during the former period. The two crises affected income inequality differently. The bubble burst led to a slow income growth for all households without greatly affecting the distribution of income, whereas the banking crisis dampened income growth exclusively among lowquantile households, exacerbating income inequality. Although the distributional effect of government policy was important, the general pattern of income inequality carried over into inequality in consumption. The dimensions of that carryover, however, diminished after the bubble burst, suggesting compositional changes in income shocks. The inequalities over life cycle are also discussed.","tags":["Inequality","Income","Consumption","Labor","Life Cycle","Wealth","NSFIE","FIES"],"title":"Inequalities in Japanese Economy during the Lost Decades","type":"project"},{"authors":["Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"da2086dd685e470588586054d8537643","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/publication/yamada_jedc_2012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yamada_jedc_2012/","section":"publication","summary":"Using an OLG model with heterogeneous households, we investigate the relationship among income risk, macroeconomic and demographic changes, and economic inequality between 1980 and 2000 in Japan. By decomposing the primary factors in earnings and consumption inequality into macroeconomic variables and the demographic variable, we find that our model replicates the evolution of economic inequality in Japan. By performing counterfactual simulations, we demonstrate that two factors—changes in time-varying macroeconomic factors and the unexpected decline in the total factor productivity growth rate—played important roles in the increase in earnings and consumption inequality in the 1990s.","tags":["Population Aging","Income Risk","Consumption Inequality","Economic Inequality","OLG Model"],"title":"Income Risk, Macroeconomic and Demographic Change and Economic Inequality in Japan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"Upload the slide used at a special lecture at Academia Sinica in Taiwan (with Gary Hansen and Minchung Hsu).

We evaluate social security reforms from two points of view: (i) the ex-ante expected value of future generations, and (ii) whether current generations prefer reform to the status-quo system, which we call political feasibility. To evaluate the reforms, we use a large-scale overlapping generations model with idiosyncratic income risk and a two-tier structure. The first tier guarantees a basic pension and the second tier consists of the earnings-related part. Calibrating the parameters of the model to the Japanese economy, we compute the transition path and the two welfare criteria. We find that, given the two-tier structure in Japan, an increase in the basic pension and the abolition of the earnings-related part of the social security system improve the welfare of future generations, and ensures political feasibility when a consumption tax is the source of revenue.","tags":["Population Aging","Social Security System","Political Economy","OLG Model"],"title":"A Politically Feasible Social Security Reform with a Two-Tier Structure","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Makoto Saito","Shiba Suzuki","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"In this paper, we explore whether markets can create endogenously good collateral in a crisis by analyzing a simple exchange economy where a country-specific catastrophic shock is shared between two countries.

When Lucas trees are traded among generations, procyclical cohort-specific shocks are shared partially via the movement of asset prices; cohorts with lower endowments may benefit more from asset pricing dynamics than cohorts with higher endowments. Given a reasonable set of parameters concerning the Japanese labor market, the evaluated welfare loss ranges from 1% to 3% in terms of the certainty equivalence consumption level. The first-best outcome may be achieved by either a combination of subsidies and taxes or the introduction of prior-to-entry markets.","tags":["Risk Sharing","OLG Model","Capital Income Tax","Inequality"],"title":"On the Intergenerational Sharing of Cohort-Specific Shocks on Permanent Income","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1257724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1257724800,"objectID":"76068571437409d200242e15f495fc24","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/publication/yamada_eb_2009/","publishdate":"2009-11-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/yamada_eb_2009/","section":"publication","summary":"The present study investigate the relationship between the persistence of uninsurable income shocks and consumption inequality over a household's life cycle in Japan.

Given this information, we examine whether this phenomenon is consistent with the standard precautionary saving model developed by Carroll (1997). Specifically, we investigate: (1) the degree of age dependence of idiosyncratic income risks; and (2) the importance of age dependence for the evolution of inequalities in consumption predicted by the household model of Carroll (1997). We find a strong age dependence of income risks, which creates a nonlinear age–variance profile of income, and the standard precautionary saving model is consistent with the observed consumption inequalities as long as we take the nonlinearity in age–variance profiles of income into account.","tags":["Income Risk","Consumption Profile","Structural Estimation"],"title":"Nonlinear Income Variance Profile and Consumption Inequality over the Life Cycle","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" 2009年1月16日に神戸大学で行われた数値計算に関する特別講義で使用したスライドです。 情報がかなり古いので注意してください。\n","date":1232064000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1232064000,"objectID":"1fb537405f65fc0f8a178db295866e45","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/computation/kobe/","publishdate":"2009-01-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/computation/kobe/","section":"computation","summary":"2009年1月16日に神戸大学で行われた数値計算に関する特別講義で使用したスライドです。","tags":null,"title":"連続講義@神戸大学","type":"computation"},{"authors":["Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":" 2008年8月28日、29日に一橋大学で行われた数値計算に関する特別講義をまとめた講義ノートです。 かなり情報が古いので注意してください。 コードは古すぎて参考にならないので再アップロードはしていません。\n","date":1219795200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1219795200,"objectID":"dd4922c77d9cc4d533d94af3cfb4c38e","permalink":"https://tomoakiyamada.github.io/computation/hitotsubashi/","publishdate":"2008-08-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/computation/hitotsubashi/","section":"computation","summary":"2008年8月28日、29日に一橋大学で行われた数値計算に関する特別講義をまとめたものです。","tags":null,"title":"連続講義@一橋大学","type":"computation"},{"authors":["Naohito Abe","Noriko Inakura","Tomoaki Yamada"],"categories":null,"content":"This paper presents an empirical analysis of a life cycle model.
